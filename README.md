## Demo: (04/02/2024)
To demo the generated data for the MSU Denver Computer Science degree follow this process.

First install nodeJS or check to see if you already have it installed.

To check type: ```node --version```. If a version is returned then nodeJS is installed.

If no version is returned then follow the instructions off this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).


After insuring that nodejs is installed, please run these commands in your terminal to install the required dependencies:

```pip install djangorestframework```

```pip install django-cors-headers```

```npm install axios```

```npm install lxml```

After installing the dependencies run the servers for the website and the Django Rest backend.

For the website type: ```npm start```

For the backend navigate to the folder ```project``` under the ```react-django``` folder and type: ```python manage.py runserver``` into the termanl to start the Django Rest API.

The application is now running.
